When would you want to create a new repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to keep track of new changes made to your work or when you want to share your work with other collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manual pull is better because I can be specific in what I want to pull and only choose certain branches. Automatic pull will change my local work whether I want to or not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I would create a fork when I want to make a copy of someone else's repository on my own GitHub. I would create a clone when I want to create a copy of a repository on my own local computer. And I would create a branch to a project if I were to test something big in a project that I did not necessarily want to be commited to the master branch yet.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that I would not have to pull from the GitHub repo, instead I could just modify as I please locally and push it. This means I can work offline and push changes faster.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would collab by sitting side by side with my partner and putting our heads together. It would take longer to implement solutions to code on both of our computers. Also I would have to share the code with him via email. Also, we would not be able to create branches and save our work online.
